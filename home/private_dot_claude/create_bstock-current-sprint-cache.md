# B-Stock Current Sprint Cache

This file contains current sprint information and assignment cache data for B-Stock Team Sprinters. It is referenced by the main CLAUDE.md file using `@bstock-current-sprint-cache.md`. This file is managed programmatically and excluded from version control.

## Current Sprint Information

- **Active Sprint**: [Sprint Name] (ID: [Sprint ID])
- **Sprint Dates**: [Start Date] - [End Date]

The active sprint will change every two weeks. The `/list-assignments` command will update this information automatically when it detects sprint changes.
