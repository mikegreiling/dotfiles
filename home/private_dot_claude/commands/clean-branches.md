# /clean-branches

Intelligently identifies and cleans up stale local git branches by analyzing merge status, activity patterns, and GitLab correlation using parallel branch analysis agents.

## Usage

```bash
/clean-branches [project-directory]
```

**Arguments:**
- `project-directory` (optional): Path to git repository to analyze. If not provided, uses current working directory.

**Examples:**
```bash
/clean-branches                                       # Analyze branches in current directory
/clean-branches ~/Projects/bstock-projects/cs-portal  # Analyze specific project
/clean-branches .                                     # Explicit current directory
```

## Strategy

### 1. Environment Validation
- Verify target directory is a valid git repository
- Fail fast if no git repository detected (never guess or assume)
- Check for required tools (analysis script, agents)

### 2. Repository Preparation  
- Fetch latest changes from origin with prune
- Discover all local branches (excluding main/master)
- Identify currently checked out branch

### 3. Complete Branch Analysis (Phase 1)
- Use git-branch-cleanup agent in parallel for ALL branches
- Provide each parallel agent with only one branch to analyze
- This agent will gather comprehensive analysis including:
  - Merge evidence and GitLab MR correlation
  - Activity patterns and staleness indicators  
  - Risk assessment and safety factors
- Categorize branches: SAFE-DELETE, PROBABLE-DELETE, MANUAL-REVIEW
- **CRITICAL**: Complete analysis of ALL branches before proceeding to Phase 2
- Do NOT delete any branches during this phase

### 4. Execute Deletions (Phase 2)
- **SAFE-DELETE branches**: Delete using `~/.claude/delete-branches.sh branch1 branch2 ...`
- Pass ALL SAFE-DELETE branches to the script in a single command
- **Current Branch Handling**: Special logic for currently checked out branch
  - Verify clean working directory or handle uncommitted changes
  - Switch to main/master before deletion
  - Warn if switching would lose uncommitted work

### 5. Comprehensive Report (Phase 3)
- Present detailed multi-line format for ALL analyzed branches
- Use key:value format with clear sections for each category
- Include specific analysis for remaining MANUAL-REVIEW branches
- Use text output only - NEVER use bash commands for report generation

## Safety Features

### Pre-Execution Validation
- ‚úÖ Require explicit git repository (no guessing)
- ‚úÖ Verify clean working directory for current branch deletion
- ‚úÖ Check for uncommitted changes that could be lost
- ‚úÖ Validate required tools are available

### During Execution
- ‚úÖ Log all deleted branch SHAs for recovery
- ‚úÖ Conservative decision making with clear evidence requirements
- ‚úÖ Special handling for protected branches (main/master)
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of current branch deletion

### Recovery Support
- ‚úÖ Generate recovery commands for all deleted branches
- ‚úÖ Store recovery log with timestamps and reasoning
- ‚úÖ Provide immediate recovery instructions if needed

## Implementation

### Critical Requirements
- **Phase Separation**: Complete ALL branch analysis before ANY deletions
- **Single Deletion Command**: Use `~/.claude/delete-branches.sh` for all deletions
- **NO BASH FOR REPORTS**: NEVER use bash commands, multi-line scripts, or command output for report generation. The final report must be pure text output from Claude, not bash-generated content that gets truncated.
- **Comprehensive Detail**: Every branch must be listed with full analysis
- **Terminology**: Use "SAFE-DELETE" not "AUTO-DELETE"

### CRITICAL: Report Generation Rules
- ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Multi-line bash scripts for formatting or generating reports
- ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Using bash command output as the primary report (user cannot see truncated output)
- ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Complex bash functions or heredocs for report generation
- ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Pure text output from Claude with all branch details
- ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Multi-line key:value format for readability

### Tools Used
This command leverages:
- **Analysis Script**: `~/.claude/analyze-git-branch.sh` for comprehensive branch data
- **Cleanup Agent**: `git-branch-cleanup` for parallel analysis and intelligent categorization
- **Deletion Script**: `~/.claude/delete-branches.sh` for safe branch deletion with logging
- **GitLab MCP Tools**: For merge request correlation and verification
- **Project Context**: Reads CLAUDE.md for project-specific configuration

## Output Format

```
üßπ GIT BRANCH CLEANUP REPORT

üìä ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
‚Ä¢ Repository: /path/to/project
‚Ä¢ Branches analyzed: 25  
‚Ä¢ Safe-deleted: 8 branches
‚Ä¢ Manual review required: 17 branches

### ‚úÖ SAFE-DELETE Branches (8 deleted)

**mg-old-feature**
- Category: SAFE-DELETE (HIGH confidence)
- Merge Status: MERGED
- GitLab MR: !567
- Last Activity: 2025-07-15 (30 days ago)
- Action: ‚úÖ DELETED
- Reasoning: Clear merge evidence, MR merged successfully

**mg-SPR-1234-fix**
- Category: SAFE-DELETE (HIGH confidence)
- Merge Status: MERGED
- GitLab MR: !456
- Last Activity: 2025-06-01 (60 days ago)
- Action: ‚úÖ DELETED
- Reasoning: Feature complete, remote branch deleted

### ‚è≥ MANUAL-REVIEW Required (17 remaining branches)

**mg-current-work**
- Category: MANUAL-REVIEW
- Status: Recent activity, unclear merge status - requires investigation

üõ°Ô∏è RECOVERY INFORMATION:
- Recovery Log: ~/.claude/clean-branch-log.txt
- All deleted branch SHAs preserved for emergency restoration
- Use format: git checkout -b branch-name-recovery <SHA>
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Failures
- **Not a git repository**: Clear error message, exit immediately
- **No project directory specified + CWD not git**: Explicit failure with usage instructions
- **Uncommitted changes on current branch**: Warn and provide options
- **Missing required tools**: Check for script and agent availability

### Runtime Issues
- **Git command failures**: Graceful degradation with clear error messages
- **Agent execution problems**: Fallback to basic analysis where possible
- **Network connectivity issues**: Continue with offline-only analysis
- **Permission issues**: Clear instructions for resolution

### Recovery Scenarios
- **Accidental deletion**: Immediate recovery commands provided
- **Incomplete cleanup**: Resume capability with state preservation
- **Analysis errors**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting

Remember: This is a powerful tool that permanently deletes branches. The implementation prioritizes safety, transparency, and recoverability while providing efficient cleanup of stale branches.
