description: Analyze current session learnings and identify improvement opportunities
---

Please analyze the current conversation session and provide insights on what was learned. Focus on:

## Learning Analysis

1. **Command/Tool Sequence Issues**: Which bash commands or tool call sequences took multiple attempts to get right? What were the specific problems encountered and why did they occur?

2. **User Guidance Requirements**: What directions did I need to give you to guide you in the right direction? Where did you initially misunderstand or go off-track?

3. **Stable Data for Caching**: What data did we need to look up in this session that appears stable enough to cache in CLAUDE.md files? Consider project IDs, user IDs, API endpoints, configuration values, or workflow patterns. Do not list anything that is _already_ cached in CLAUDE.md memory files.

4. **User Preferences and Style**: What did you learn about my preferences, coding style, or workflow patterns that could inform future interactions?

5. **Process Optimizations**: What workflows could be streamlined to use fewer prompts and tool calls in the future?

## Actionable Recommendations

Based on your analysis, provide **at least three specific recommendations** that could be codified in Claude Code memory files to improve future sessions. For each recommendation, specify:

- What should be documented or cached
- Which CLAUDE.md file should contain it (user, organization, or project level)
- The expected benefit to future workflows

Focus on practical, implementable improvements that would reduce friction and improve efficiency in similar future tasks.
